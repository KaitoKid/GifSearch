# GifSearch

Google only lets me do 100 searches a day without paying.

## To Install

Clone this repo and run the commands:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/KaitoKid/GifSearch.git
# Go into the repository
cd GifSearch
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app
npm start
```

If you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) (which I highly recommend):

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/KaitoKid/GifSearch.git
# Go into the repository
cd GifSearch
# Install dependencies
yarn
# Run the app
yarn start
```

## To Do

1. Global hotkey to launch it
2. Run in taskbar/background
3. Clean up the method of redoing the layout with preloading or lazy loading
